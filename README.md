# Tweeter Project

Welcome to Tweeter, a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Here you can tweet all you want! Although nobody else is here...

Other than the randomly generated names and handful of avatars accompanying them! Here, you can tweet out as someone completely random, because well there's no log in functionality (as of yet)!

Really though, this is just a simple project to tinker with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, and AJAX on the front-end, and Node along with Express on the back-end.

This project was completed for my bootcamp studies at Lighthouse Labs, and the majority of the direction for the project is also sourced from Lighthouse Labs.
